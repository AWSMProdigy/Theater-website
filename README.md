## Description
 A movie theater website with useful tools for organizing your trip to the theater.
## User Story
Allow me to paint you a picture, you've had a long hard day of backbreaking work at Bamazon, and the grouptext with your friends has been absolutly popping off. You see a text from Greg that says "Does the 8:00pm showing of "Solar Conflicts ep.4" work for everybody?" 8:00pm works great for you, and so you buy a ticket for the 8:00pm showtime. Then you put your phone back in your pocket. But 8:00pm doesnt work for your friend Mark, so your friends change the showtime on you to 5:00pm. You arrive at the movies "on time" just to see your friends exiting the theater, gleefully gesticulating the various scenes from the movie you just missed. You've already payed for the movie, so you force yourself to go inside, alone, you purchase yourself a 32oz DrPepper that costs an arm and a leg, and a small bag of popcorn because you have no friends. You stumble through the darkness to find your seat, a small refuge precariously placed between 2 body builders. You place your elbows on your lap as the armrests are taken and then some. The opening credits roll, you bring a small kernel of corn to your mouth slowly. You begin to cry, which saturates your popcorn with tears.

You should've went to Reel Cinema.
